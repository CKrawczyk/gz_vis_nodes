============

Galaxy Zoo visualization using a node tree

The node tree is made using d3 and js.

To run locally open index.html in a browser.

The nodes can be collapsed by clicking on them. Clicking a second time will bring the links back.

There are 3 sliders at the top that can be used to adjust the tree:
+ `Charge`: How much the nodes repel each other
+ `Link Strength`: How streachy the links are
+ `Friction`: How damped the motion is

The `Reset` button will set all the sliders back to their default position.
